Reserve a random TCP port on Unix system. First, compile
it using `make`:

> make

Then, run without arguments:

> reserve

You should get a random TCP port number in standard output.

The tool first tries to allocate a random port in 5000-5099 interval. If
none of them are available, it will try to allocate a random in 1024-65535
interval. If after 400 attempts no ports are available it will exit
with a non-zero code (255) and print an error to stderr.

None of these parameters are configurable at the moment. You're welcome
to submit a pull request :)
